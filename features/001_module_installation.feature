Feature: Module installation
  In order to study bible text
  I first install a bible module

  @no-kjv-needed @stop-after
  Scenario: ASV installation
    Given I open the module installation assistant
    And I choose to add translations
    And the repository update date matches today
    And I select the English language
    And I select the CrossWire repository
    And I select the ASV module for installation

    When the installation is completed

    Then the ASV is available as a local module
    And Strong's are available as local modules
    And the relevant buttons in the menu are enabled
