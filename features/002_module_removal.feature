# features/002_module_removal.feature

Feature: Module removal
  If a module is no longer relevant for my bible study
  I can remove that module

  @needs-asv-before @no-kjv-needed
  Scenario: ASV removal
    Given I open the module installation assistant
    And I choose to remove translations
    And I select the ASV module for removal

    When the removal is completed

    Then the ASV is no longer available as a local module
