## [0.9.0] - 2019-08-23
### Features
* Tags can now be shown in a column next to the bible text. This is particularly useful when having a lot of tags, as it gives more overview and makes it easier to focus on the text.
* Section titles (from SWORD modules) can now be shown/hidden based on an option in the menu.
* Information about SWORD modules can now be shown before installation when using the bible translation wizard.
* Automatic upload of information to Sentry.io in case of JavaScript bugs
* Additional packages/platforms:
  - macOS support (macOS build produces signed & notarized DMGs compatible with macOS 10.14 Mojave)
  - Installer for Windows app
  - OpenSuse Leap 15.1 package
  - Debian 10 package
  - Linux Mint 18 package

### Enhancements

* Show number of tagged verses in title of tagged verse list popup.
* Show SWORD version in bible module info dialogue.
* Added Windows build instructions ([#2][i2]).
* Upgraded Electron from 4.2.6 to 4.2.9.

### Fixes
* Corrected bug with Sword paths on Windows and Unix. Now both the user path and the global path gets evaluated correctly both on Windows and on Unix.
* Only disable close button of first tab when it's the last one.
* Remember the last selected bible translation and set that as a default for new tabs.
* Properly rename tab titles containing tags after tag has been renamed.
* Sword backend: Also retrieve empty verses, but only if corresponding bible book is generally existing (applies to John 5:4 for some translations).
* Optimized package size (when packaging remove build artifacts not necessary for production).

## [0.8.1] - 2019-06-21
### Features
* Sync functionality for Sword modules that are already existing locally: On startup any modules not yet used by Ezra Project are imported into the database.

### Enhancements
* Link with static Sword library (version 1.8.1), so that dependency to specific Sword package can be avoided.
* Streamlined startup
  * Upgrade the database using migrations (based on Umzug library)
  * Loading indicator for slower systems

### Fixes
* sword.conf file is not created anymore. This "overwrote" the Sword module path in the previous releases. On Windows, modules are found both in the user directory and the "all users" directory. ([#5][i5])
* Support for all languages of ISO-639-1/2/3. This enables the usage of all the available Sword modules.
