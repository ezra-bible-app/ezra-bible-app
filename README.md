## Join the team!
Your contributions to Ezra Project are very welcome!
At the moment this is a small project with just one maintainer. It would be great to have a team developing this software.
Ideally you should bring some experience in working with web-based frontends, specifically HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Furthermore, experience with relational database design is a plus. However, if you're not a developer you can still help with testing, translation and user documentation!

Feel free to drop me an email ([contact@tklein.info](mailto:contact@tklein.info)) if you are interested in joining the team!
