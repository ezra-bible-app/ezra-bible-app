"_For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel._" Ezra 7:10

Ezra Project is a bible study software focussing on topical study based on keywords/tags. This program helps the user to easily create and manage topical verse lists. Ezra Project works with [SWORD bible translation modules](http://www.crosswire.org/sword) and thus enables bible study in many languages. It runs on Linux and Windows.
